Hello All, 

This project started as a way to create a user interface which artists and creators can use along with their existing workflows. An Interface for artists and creators. Instead of being just an immage generator, it is supposed to aid users in creating art and designs in the app itself. Just as Adobe Firefly was revealed few days ago, it seemed our vision alligns with how adobe invisions AI generative artwork to be. Unfortunately we are not able to work on this any longer. As of right now the interface is very basic with only text to image generations working. We will be posting the UX and UI designs of our figma files to illustrate how we envisioned the final product to look like. Have a go at it if this interests you.
